About the TA
------------

The DB CyberTech DBN-6300 uses syslog to provide event reporting to a central Security Information and Event Management 
(SIEM) system and to report general system health information. Syslog output is encoded in the Common Event Format (CEF), 
which allows easy integration into a number of common security information and event management (SIEM) andlog-analysis tools. 
DB CyberTech can provide sample integration with popular tools. This manual describes the DBN-6300 syslog messages.
